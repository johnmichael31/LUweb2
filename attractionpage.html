                        <h1>Pindangan Ruins</h1>
                        <p>The ruins is one of the top places to visit in La Union and refers to the remains of a church built by Augustinian
                        priests in the late 1700s during the Spanish colonial period, while Pindangan, an Ilocano word which translates to “a
                        place for drying fish,” is where local inhabitants used to lay out salted fish to dry out in the sun, a process of
                        preserving and curing meat that the town of San Fernando is known for to this day.</p>

                        <h1>Gapuz Grapes Farm</h1>
                        <p>When tourists visit La Union, one of the first things that typically comes to mind is the beach. Most visitors associate
                        the town with surfing, swimming under the heat of the sun, and enjoying the tropical weather. But what most travelers
                        don't know is that La Union is also a top farm tour destination in the Philippines. One of the top farms in La Union is
                        the Gapuz Grapes Farm.</p>

            Ma-Cho Temple (Taoist Temple)
            <p>The Ma-Cho Temple’s architecture cuts a striking image across the La Union skyline. Nestled on top of a hill at an
                elevation of 70 above sea level along Quezon Avenue in San Fernando, the highest point offers a panoramic view of
                the
                West Philippine Sea and San Fernando harbor. It is the first Taoist temple in the Philippines that was built in 1975
                to
                honor the Chinese sea-goddess Mazu.</p>
