                    San Fernando was founded in 1786 (the “cabecera” or provincial capital-seat of La Union province in 1850). The City’s
                    origin, San Vicente de Balanac and San Guillermo de Dalangdang, the 2 settlements during Spanish times, were attacked by
                    pirates and headhunters.
